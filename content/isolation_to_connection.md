# PhD - A lonely Start
I started my PhD directly after Covid (2022). 
Although I knew a few people from the working group already, personal interaction was difficult at the start. 

```{tip} New Place, New People, New Topic
:label: tip:lonely-start
Feeling lonely at the start of your PhD (or any other career point) is normal. Most of us have been there!
```

# The First Year

You go to your first conference, workshop, you meet new people, you learn new things about your topic.
But it's also overwhelming! Don't know where to start with your own research. Your topic might change. Instructions are unclear.

And then there might be a completely new thing to some of you: A BIG COLLABORATION!
Although in general I stand by the point that people science tend to be open and welcoming, difficult people definitely exist!

```{tip} A dive into the scientific community
- Pros: Conferences, workshops, new people, THE COLLABORATION
- Cons: Topic changes, unclear instructions, THE COLLABORATION (yes again)
```

As your PhD further progress you might get the feeling that you are the only one struggling (good ol' imposter syndrom) or that there
is nobody in the group or collaboration that can help. 

```{blockquote}
Nobody is working on my topic, I don't know who to ask for help ðŸ˜©

--- Me at some point probably
```

```{important} The realisation
You are stuck - feeling like there is no alternative to this Limbo
```

# The turning Point

I attended a workshop by ErUM-Data-Hub in 2023 on sustainibility in ErUM research. All participants got invited to join "Hannover Messe" (one of world's biggest trade fairs) a few weeks later.
Me and two other people from Dortmund decided to take the opportunity and look for some potential job offers by the companies attending. 
Little did I know that I would actually go home with a job offer from ErUM-Data-Hub! (or at least the offer to apply, there was an interview later)

```{tip} Pro tip
Connect with other outside of your field!
```

Part of my job at the Hub was to attend a vast amount of workshops and schools we organized for all kinds of physics communities. 
I met so many new people from different fields.

```{tip} Conclusion
Network is key but some treat it as a game.

# Finding my People

The people I stayed in touch with were the people I could talk about coding problems during the coffee breaks.
Then I realized something very important and life changing (regarding my research):

```{note} Another Realisation
People are indeed working on the same topic! Not in my working group, not in my collaboration, BUT in other field!
```

```{note} The Room where it happens (-Aaron Burr, Hamilton the Musical)
The exchange I was looking for happens online, on platforms like GitHub!
