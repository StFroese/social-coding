# Reframing OSS

What if I told you GitHub is the most useful *social* platform in research?

```{tip} OSS
:label: oss-social
Open Source is not just about publishing code. It's about how we *collaborate*, how we give feedback, and how we connect.
```

```{figure} ../media/github.jpg

```

GitHub is the place where conversations happen.

```{tip} The rooms
:label: git-rooms
- Issues = Report bugs, Ask for features, Show your interest
- Pull Request = I tried `xy`, what do you think? - Engage

```

```{tip} Jobs
:label: jobs
Just a small comment: GitHub is like a modern CV
```

# What OSS taught me

Most conversations you will have, are not only about how to write better code but on how people _think_ about problems.

```{tip} Conversations
:label: conversations
- Not limited to code
- Learn how others approach problems
- Learn how you communicate clearly with others
- Learn how to give and receive feedback
```

```{note}
:label: friends
The more you engage the more you get to know the people - your future friends!
```

# What happened next

```{note} Un-Stuck
:label: unstuck
- I stopped feeling stuck
- I started felling part of something (cheesy, but socially a common thing among humans)
- I got insight from others 
  - not only helping me develop my analysis but also socially
```

# The roles of OSS

You can take any role you want:

```{tip} Roles
:label: oss-roles

-	🧠 Author – You built something.
-	🔧 Maintainer – You take care of it.
-	🙋‍♀️ Contributor – You fixed something.
-	👀 User – You noticed something.
```


```{important}
:label: skills
Everyone has a skill that is useful for someone, and therefore anyone can contribute.
```

```{important} Contribution
:label: contribute
Not limited to code! There are docs, there is project organization, there is outreach and communitation to audiences, there are tutorial, workshop. It is a community! 
```
