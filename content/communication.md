# Open Research

Hot topic. 

What is research output?

```{tip} Research Output
:label: output
- üß™ Code
- üìä Data
- üìì Notebooks
- üìÑ Docs/tutorials
- üßµ Threads and blogs
- üó£Ô∏è Talks and teaching materials
```

```{note} This it the Way
:label: the-way
From Open Data to Open Notebooks and everythin in between.

BUT: Won't somebody steal my work? Definitly an ethical decision to make!

Don't get stuck in the citation-reward system of peer reviews. 

Step forward towards open science as the alternative to waiting for the peer review.
```

:label: oa
The relative citation rate = mean citation rate of OA articles divided by the mean citation rate of non-OA articles.
[McKiernan et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16800)
```

# Metric beyond citations

```note{Metrics}
- Downloads
- Reuse in talks/notebooks
- Stars or forks on GitHub
- People emailing you!
```

# Reproducability

You might already know that word.

```{warning} Hot Take
Science that is not reproducable can't be trusted!
(Or at least you should be skeptical, as always) 
```
More concepts apply:

```

```{tip} The Black Box
Although the above concepts are worth to implement they loose their purpose if the "_process_" is not understandable / a black box.
```

# Communicate your Research


1. Open Notebooks

2. Blog posts, e.g. The [How I Fail series](https://veronikach.com/failure/)

3. Lay Summaries (Summary of a research project written for members of the public)


4. Talks and posters (you know that one)
5. Social media (Mastodon/Bluesky or whatever we use next year)
